Custom interactive visualization for VEDA

Showing methane emission plumes.

You can learn more about how to access [this data](https://dev.ghg.center/api/stac/collections/nasa-jpl-plumes-emissions-updated) directly in [the VEDA documentation](https://nasa-impact.github.io/veda-docs).

⚠️ This visualization is created using a [jupyterlite-pyodide-kernel](https://github.com/jupyterlite/pyodide-kernel) and [voici](https://voici.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). It is rendered client-side (in your browser!) via the magic of [Wasm](https://webassembly.org/). This is an exciting and rapidly evolving space which means that this visualization is highly experimental and likely to break. ⚠️
